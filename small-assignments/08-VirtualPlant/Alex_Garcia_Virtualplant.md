Green Crystaline
My plant is meant to have the shape of an egg and it's structure look like stained glass. It's also got these thin vein like tubes all around the plant itslef which would help reinforce said plant and give it structure. The Plant can then be plucked and used to make a new matieral stronger than steel, looks better, and cheaper too since there would be an abundance of these plants across the world. With this the buildings have higher chances of surviving natural disasters
