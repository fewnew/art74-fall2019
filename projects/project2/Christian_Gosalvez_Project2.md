  My project is meant to play into a person's sense of action yet also wonder hence why I used variations of reds in the piece. I wanted create a piece that was abstract enough to make people question it, yet it could possibly be seen in a film or show as a sci-fi scene.  It allowed me to mess with different objects that could be altered in different ways to almost make it look like I was creating a movie with a bunch of different scenes taking place in the same setting or environment.
  
  I wanted to make it so that people looking at the piece feel as though time is frozen while they were watching a heated battle between two ships taking place in the desert.  I made it in a way so that they can be in different viewpoints for the same battle.  I got some reference from the movie Star Wars: The Last Jedi.  I wanted it to be somewhat remeniscent of the scene where they have ships fighting in a desert.
