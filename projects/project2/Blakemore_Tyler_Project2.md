Project 2 Description

"Hall of Rivals"

Attribution: All models come with the program. 

Description: My sculpture was inspired by A Game Of Thrones' Hall of Faces and Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes. I tried to create a tense feeling of riveraly by placing two different spiecies head next to eachother in a temple. I also used effects in Sketchfab to create a more in tense overall vibe. I had a lot of issues with this project but ultimately was able to get it in with the website portfolio as well. I comepletely forgot to upload it here.
