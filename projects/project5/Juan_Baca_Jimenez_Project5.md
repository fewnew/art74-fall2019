Friendly alien and 3D motion 
P5js.org
For this assignment I was exploring around p5js.org.
This is my first time using p5js.org. 
The first piece is called Friendly Alien and I was exploring around features the website provided and what I am able to input into my interactive piece of work.
I created a creature that reminded me of cartoonist looking alien.
With an interactive background.

The second piece of work is a 3D sphere and cube attached to each other with a circular motion in a 2D plane. I'm still trying to explore around with this work. I'm really liking what you can create with p5jr.org whether its 2D or 3D and gives human interaction. It's really cool.
