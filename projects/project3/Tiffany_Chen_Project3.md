Title: Earth
Medium: Video collage
Duration: 1 minute 47 seconds

Description

This video is called Earth, I want to create something that represent that our Earth is dying from global warming or
polutions that have been going on. All the images in between is like the destruction that's going on and if this continues,
in the end of the video the Earth is not there anymore but another round thing. The song I used is also called In The End
which is like saying we should think about the end result when we deside to do anything.
