### Description
I created "The Battle" by picking out assets I thought worked well together and slowly pieced them to form an interesting, storytelling narrative.
The inspiration behind my piece is mainly the physical form of fighting, but I also wanted to imply the importance of the fight that isn't against someone else, 
but rather, one's own self. My video is a abstract, non-linear storytelling piece that details that fight within the subject and between her and her opponent. 
When my video is viewed, I want people to feel the intensity of the battle between these two figures, but I also want them to understand 
that there is another fight going on that is not necessarily being portrayed.
