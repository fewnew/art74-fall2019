What does your project look/sound/smell/feel like?

I wanted my project to feel relaxed as if you were alone or as if you were calmly exploring and having fun. I think the video accompanies the music really well in expressing this mood of mental and emotional self care and happiness.

What is the conceptual/personal/political motivation behind the project?

I think the motivation behind my project was to just let other people feel like their mental and emotional health is just as important instead of working all the time or having people tell you what you can do and what you can achieve, instead you should always just look for happiness in the end.

What is the intended context? Where/how does the audience experience it?

I wanted the audience to feel as if they were in the places on the screen, just observing and taking in the whole experience and view of their surroundings. I think the song accompanying the video really helps the viewer feel at peace and or inspired to explore.

What/who are your influences for this particular piece?

Influences on the piece would be the author of the song that I used. This song brought a lot of feelings out of me and it made me want to go hiking somewhere nice and just take some time for me alone.
