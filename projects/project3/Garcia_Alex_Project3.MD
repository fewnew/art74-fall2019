Name: Thunder
Duration: 1:01
Description: Lately I'v been thinking of my favorite convert I'v been to and that's the Imagine Dragons concert a few years ago. I've also been listening to their music a lot lately as well and while opening the adobe premire application for the first time I saw some really cool lightning videos right off the bat and knew right then and thwre I'd make a montage/tribute to Imagine Dragons's hit song "Thunder"

Sidenote: I intended to add text saying the words lightning and thunder when the video said it but was unable to figure this out as the youtube videos's actions would not take me to the correct setup
