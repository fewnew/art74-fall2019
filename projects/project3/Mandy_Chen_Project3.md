What does your project look/sound/smell/feel like?

My project smells like fall and it sounds calm. 

What is the conceptual/personal/political motivation behind the project?

The personal motivation behind this project is I want to group the videos I filmed in this year. I filmed lots of videos this year but I never get the chance to group them together so I think grouping them will be fun.

What is the intended context? Where/how does the audience experience it?

The intended context is to relax and watch the film and maybe start to review your 2019. The audience experience it while wwatching the film.

What/who are your influences for this particular piece?

I think I am influences everyone because it will kind of remind them what they did over this year.
