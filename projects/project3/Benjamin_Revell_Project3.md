### Description
I always loved the look of ink through water so I decided to make the theme
of this video to show how cool it can be. Instead of making the entire video
nice and smooth to flow with the ink I decided to match the tone of the music
with some abrupt cuts and some glitchy looking video effects. The use of chroma
keying and blending modes was used a few times.
