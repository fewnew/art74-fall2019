### Description
My project with this video was to make a video highlighting my favorite weather. I wanted to implement my favorite weather with abstract images. I placed abstract images that represent the feeling or image of each weather. I place raindrops on top of the raining images and distorted their colors. I also wanted to show the satisfying aspect of each weather with the slow transitions and the video of the ice melting. I wanted this video to be satisfying and calming to the viewers as well as give them insight into how I see each weather.
