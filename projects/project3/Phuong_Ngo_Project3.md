What does your project look/sound/smell/feel like?

At first, my project gives an impression of a crowded and lively city, but later on, it will take you to many more places with a variety of Asian foods, especially street food, one of the most significant culture that has always existed in many asian countries for a very long time.


What is the conceptual/personal/political motivation behind the project?


The motivation behind this project is to focus in another type of culinary that many people often forget about: street foods - those that are prepared not inside your kitchen or at any fancy restaurant, but rather in the carts and stalls lining busy streets and quiet alleys.


What is the intended context? Where/how does the audience experience it?


The intended context is to enjoy the timelapse of asian cities, from early morning to the afternoon and at night. At each time of the day, people tend to have certain types of meal, and that makes street food into both quick snacks for people in a rush and dishes that are full of flavor and cultural history.


What/who are your influences for this particular piece?


It suddenly came to my mind that every since i left my home country, it has been a long time since my last meal that's blessed by those delicious food that can only be found in simple carts on the street. I really missed the delicious range of texture and flavor of those simple dishes, and that gave me the reason for making this as my last project for this course.
