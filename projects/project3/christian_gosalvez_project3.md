Description:
  While choosing clips for this video, I tried to find videos that seemed peaceful and serene, hence the name Serenity.  I tried to make viewers feel at peace and not overwhelmed by a lot of different pieces to it.  I wanted to allow people to feel relaxed while watching it.  I normally feel at peace while looking at the sky or by thinking about places that have a darker feel while also not being pitch black.
