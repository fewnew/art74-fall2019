### Description
Wonder in Motion intendeds to create an ethereal, hypnotic observation of dance and movement. Through the sequence of videos and layering of the two themes at the end, a daydream narrative comes to life. The narrative eludes to a young womanâ€™s fantasy of being a ballerina. Twirling in the field, she is imagining what it would be like to perform a solo on stage. The mood is intended to be nostalgic of childhood dreams as well peaceful or inspiring.
