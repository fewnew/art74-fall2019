This video project, I was first exploring with pixabay with the short videos it provided for me to download and upload onto adobe premiere pro and I am actually excited of what I came up with from gathering these audios into premiere pro because I felt that it all relates to each other with the color and motion, and of course the fireworks. This project I went for a New Year's theme, as we are heading to a brand new year in a couple of weeks. I thought this topic for the video would fit around this time of the year. I chose a song that I liked for a background for this 1 min video from freemusicarchive.org.
I'm really happy with this work and I'm actually encouraged to do more videos and explore more with premiere pro.
