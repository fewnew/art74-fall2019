I wanted to call this video "Night Life"

Video was suppose to be 1,920 x 1,080 But a specific clip was clearly not the correct formating. 

Duration: 2:20
I accidently "stacked" them I believe. I did not have time to correct this mistake.

I wanted to create a video that represented that type of college/club/rave scen. I think clubbing is a really interesting thing that we do when we are in college. Most of the time we are too intoxicated to really be able to taken in the beauty of what is going on. That is what I intended to do with this video.
