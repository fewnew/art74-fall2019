Response to Kate Horsfield Busting the Tube: A Brief History of Video Art.

In Busting the Tube, Kate Horsfield begins with a brief overview of the political undertones that stimulated the growth of video art. Horsfield describes how the underrepresented minority in mainstream society wanted to break the reigns of oppressive media and social control. In the 1950’s, television was the most powerful means of communicating a widestream message. However, this message was often biased and exclusive of diversity. Kate Horsfield states “intellects and media theorists saw that it reinforced the status quo.”

The introduction of the portable video camera opened up a whole new window for the minority to challenge the established status quo in media culture. At first, video cameras were used mainly for their documentary abilities when it came to artistic performances. However, with the expansion of new technology, artists began to test the boundaries of video recording through creating video collages and abstract films. Artists such as Nam June Paik, are still famous today for their experimental films and Video Installations.
