The time period being discussed here seemes very fun with rock and roll and the begining of something new with all the type of experiments on art regarding technology and I do agree with mass theorist Herbert Marcuse about mass media depriving from social control 
The feminist of back then seem much more reasonable with their approach using art as a way to get their voices out there and they don't seem to be degrading men, they more so want to be seen as equal while some feminist of today have gone off course and actually try to degrade men, consider themselves above men (despite that destroying everythung they supposedly stand for), and even going as far as to "punish" men for simple acts like man spreading (opening your legs instead of closing them) by pouring bleach on their legs compared to back then where they demand the people to anaylyse power relatiions between genders in their structure
