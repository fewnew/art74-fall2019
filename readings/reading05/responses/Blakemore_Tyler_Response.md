A quick history on Video art was a intersting article that really went into the roots of where video art started. Reading through all these articles and other past historical references about art, it seems to me that most of the time it is politically motivated. I thought that that very first connection the author made about video art starting to come to a rise during the 60's. The human rights movment had many players and interest groups and with new technologies, these groups were finding different ways off getting their statements across.
