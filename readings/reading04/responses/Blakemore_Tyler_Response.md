Agumented reality or AR for short, was a game changer when I first saw it. Augmented reality allows for what some people call "non-visual visualities" come to life. What people whish the world was like or what they see the world as, artist are now able to actually make that come to life. Art has always been a form of expression of politics and the world around us. But now Art is able to change the way that we litterally visualize the world.
