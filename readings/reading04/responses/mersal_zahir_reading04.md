In this article it talks about AR, or augmented reality. Before reading this article I didn't think much of AR and assumed it was way more technology based than art based. After reading this article however, I learned just how artistic AR really is and how much of a creative process it is. Art is seen as a big process of augmented reality as it can create different works with it. This is an incredible new way of creating technilogical art for digital artists that can have an impact in how we see the real world.
