The mid-90’s was when net.art began to take shape. Artists found the internet as a big platform to share their art and ideas. In net.art, email was the biggest means for communication within the community. This allowed people to connect with each other no matter where in the world they were. This art movement gathered a cult following as the internet and all its forms were still new to the world. Eventually companies started to pick up traction on the internet. It started to become cluttered but that didn’t stop artists from getting their agendas out there. At the earliest time, mostly sites with political and social agendas could be seen. This paved a way for a new media age. 

I think the beginnings of net.art are very interesting. The internet is such a big part of our society today, so reading about it’s origins and the artists that were first to originally pioneer it is fascinating. I definitely would’ve liked to see what the internet community was like back then compared to now. It was a whole different game back then and I would’ve wanted to experience it first hand.
