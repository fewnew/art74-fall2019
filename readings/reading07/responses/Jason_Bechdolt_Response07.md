Net.art is an aesthetic created out of various computer symbols and assets, that seeks to stray from the normal method of communication. Net.art as a name was created enitely by accident when Vuk Cosic, the man who popularized the phrase, discovered "net.art" to be the only legible phrase in a glitched message that he recieved. The popularity of the pratice of this style began around 1994-1998, a period of time when communities began to form around the style. Net.art grew especially in Eastern Europe and Russia, as the concept of the internet as a place where they could say or do anything was quite exciting to groups of people who had been creatively caged for so long. Around 1994/1995 was when the first major net.art websites began to arrise, and became the primary places for the community to flourish. Irrationality.org, and Jodi.org where the two most exemplary examples of how Net.art sought to deviate from the typical form of things by looking at things in their most raw and confusing data form. At some point concern began to arise that corporations would begin to take over the internet, so a website called name.space presented the idea of adding new URL types (.com,.org etc.) to prevent monopolizing of the limited components.
The largest burst in Net.art popularity occured in 1997, and was also a time when women and Feminism began to become more strongly represented in the practice. The access of internet in Africa Asia and australia also became a talking point about a year later. Feminism was not always well recieved however as some sites disalowed discussion on the topic. The image of the desktop became iconic as it is a core part of the experience that a user has with their computer. It's cool to learn about all this stuff that existed before I was born, especially since both of my parents were software engineers at the time, so they were there to witness it. Generally I don't hear much about what the internet was before the 2000s, and hearing that people had concerns about corporate polution of the internet is quite bittersweet to hear, as uite a few of their ears have come true. This also reminds me of the current state of youtube, where people often reminisce about the days when youtube was a site for creators and not one built to appeal to advertisers and produce profits.
