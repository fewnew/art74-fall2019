This article shows a really interesting perspective on net art. At first glance it is very "glitchy" and almost looks half assed. Reading the history of where net.art came from (and how recent that was) made me have a new perspective on digital art. I would like to think about it almost as the graffiti of digital art in some ways.Very rebelious but not nonsensical, there is definitely order and an art behind the form.
