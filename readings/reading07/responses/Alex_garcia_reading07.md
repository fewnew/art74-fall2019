The origin of net art is actually pretty humorous and surprisnly not some sort of movement due to inspiring new artist or some new form of technology formuated but rather an email that was glithded out, with the simple term "net art". The technologically based art platforms are very intriguing to me as it's no longer the usual paintings or sketches but rather digialtized art composed in codes and files which can be shifted and molded throughout the years.The ambitions and spreading of net art seems to be similar to those of other art platforms where people see it and it spreads being described as an infection, and although this word is usually viewed negatively it's meaning here actually helps contributue to how fast and valued this art platform was and what it's meant to be. 

While not all of the art shown here may appeal to me due to it's inverted color look of just code such as black and green, some of it does intrigue me quite a lot such as the 2nd image in blue with all of the computer applications shown being interesting icons such as a rubiz cube, a bus, or a TV vesrus a W for word or a notepad, these icons all help to make this piece stand out as it's beautiful chaos due to the icons also being randomly placed out of order. Another image is the black and white image containing the child on the right of the herritage gold on the cover with more black and white images like a man staring at the screen with some text hwll to display a tone of mysteriousness and give a personality towards the user seeing this.
