Generative art refers to “any art practice where the art uses a system, such as a natural set of any language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is then set into motion to create a complete work of art. However, software art describes an artistic activity which in the medium of software allows for a critical reflection of software. These two terms are related to each other, but their relativity can be unclear. Generative art focus on the surface created by a generative process. While software art focuses on the generative process which might generate surfaces or other results. There is quite a difference in what the two focus on but they are similar in the sense that they work with the same bases.
	
I find it interesting how this type of art can allow people to manipulate technology. It’s scary to think about that there are people who can do this and how easy it can be to do it. There’s so much to learn with software and coding that it makes me dizzy thinking about it. However I definitely find it intriguing and exciting. This is not a type of art I hear about on the regular so I would love to learn more about it.
