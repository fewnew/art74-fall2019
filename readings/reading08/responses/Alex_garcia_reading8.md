Right off the bat this article starts off using words i don't know or understand what they're regerring to and I feel pretty du,b since It's saying the meaning is pretty obious, but asides from this I have found the term software art interesting as it reminds of the glitch program we did back in the begining of this class period where we had an image we'd open up in a software not intended for it and delete or add coding so that when we reload the image it would look different than what it once was with a very glitched like look to it where it could be pixalated, inverted colors, flipped, chopped, etc. 
While the author of the article makes a point about how generative art does not equal software art, i must say i disagree as I don't think the intention of generative art is you must follow the exact rules about how the applications and systems are used, more so than if you use them or not. Using the same tools as generative art should give you software art as well as that seems to be the intended focus and not the differences in how the applications may be utilized
