Response to Arns Inke Read Me, Run Me, Execute Me,

In Read Me, Run Me, Execute Me, Arns Inke breaks down the difference between generative art and software art. Inke defines generative art as a product of a system that creates and repeats unpredictable outcomes. The focus on generative art is the final image, not the “nuts and bolts” below the surface. Conversely, software art’s intent is to work with and expose the underpinnings of media processes. Software art brings the invisible workings of codes and algorithms to the foreground. 

I find it interesting that most media art centers around a political agenda, specifically concerning freedom of information and freedom of representation. In a way it causes you to question what is more important: the author’s right to trademark and receive pay for their product or the consumers rights to freedom of information?
