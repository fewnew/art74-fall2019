In this reading, I was surprised by the differences between the two types of art. I would have assumed that the two types of art general and software were extremely different.  General art to me sounds like paintings and drawings. Whereas software art would be coded images or graphic design. General art focuses on the surface and is created by a generative process. Sometimes software is used in general are like code but it is simply a tool serving to create a certain result. the code is used to be efficient and create something beautiful. I never would have thought of General art as something that would be using updated technology like coding other types of software. 

Software as a culture and as art is is that question right now. Software art can be experimental and non-pragmatic. Software or code can be used to make art or be considered art itself. This confuses me because I never thought as numbers and letters in code being art. I also didn't realize you could create art with code or software, I was only thinking about how you create websites and games.
