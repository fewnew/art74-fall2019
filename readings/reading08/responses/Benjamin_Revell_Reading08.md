Inke Arns' Read_me run_me execute_me is an informational artcile on the differences
between two similar art mediums. One being Generative Art and the other being 
Software Art. At first glance the two seem almost identical in both message and
appearance, but they differ in a few ways. While Generative Art focuses on 
the "surface" created by a generative process, Software Art focuses on the
generative process which might create a surface as a result. Essentially 
Generative art is about the result (what the code outputs) and Software Art
is about the code. 

I found both of these types of art mediums slightly confusing. While I think
I understand how they differ (at least I hope so), the messages that they both 
seem to send is still blurry to me. If a few more examples were shown from a more
recent time period maybe their ideas wouldn't be lost on me. I do think elegant 
code looks beautiful and thats something that I think everyone can appreciate.
