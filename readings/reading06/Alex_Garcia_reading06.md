In the reading from the 3D Adivist Manifesto it goes over right away that this form of art is a metaphor or an expression using said matierals is not only cruel but coarse as well since the "potential belies the given creativity". Going over how much the machines with humans are wanted saying it's the most valued thing in the world, more so than Edward Snowden's brief case shows the seriousness behind this. Using other phrases such as "in order to succeed one must give birth to post human machines" shows not only the extremities of this but the creativity as well. Comparing machines to sex organs is a very unique take on this and has peaked my interest although there are several words in this that make it difficult to understand as i don't quite understand the text.

Next the text goes over additivisim which gives 2 different meanings. one saying that "additivisim can emancipate us" and that "additivisim will eradicate us" Now this is interesting as emancipate means to set free while eradicate means to destroy. How exactly are 2 opposite words being used to describe the same word? Well the text actuslly ignores that and onstead goes back into wierd phrases such as "let us birth dissary from it's digital chamber" in refrerance to photopolymors and shiny shinter metals being used to 'forge anarchy, revolt, and distemper". From here it gives a wierd list of additive manifestos.
