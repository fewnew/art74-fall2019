The Turtle Bag. Created by a 3D printer, this eco friendly exo skelton is suppose to be placed on the backs of turtles and allows for them to be able to distinguish jelly fish from plastic bags. This product challanges the question of; Should we mess with nature? This exo skeleton was created by humans as an extension for turtles. Although it is suppose to overall help them, it is only helping them from what we have created.
